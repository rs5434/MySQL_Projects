- An Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram is an advanced version of the traditional Entity-Relationship (ER) diagram that includes additional concepts to represent more complex data relationships. EER diagrams extend the basic ER model by incorporating features like subclasses, superclasses, specialization, generalization, and categories. This allows for a more nuanced representation of real-world entities and their relationships, facilitating a better understanding of the underlying data structure.
